# Deep Learning Project

## Description
This project is a deep learning implementation for image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It aims to classify images into different categories with high accuracy.

## Features
- Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the model's performance.
- Model Architecture: The deep learning model is built using a CNN architecture, which consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Training: The model is trained using a large dataset and optimized using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.
- Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Deployment: The project includes instructions on how to deploy the trained model on different platforms or frameworks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-project.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the `data/README.md` file.
2. Run the preprocessing script to preprocess the data:
   ```shell
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model using the preprocessed data:
   ```shell
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```shell
   python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Deploy the trained model using the instructions in the `deployment/README.md` file.
